Yes, that's right, I should stay here in the root directory of the exercise as I'm an "extra file".

Since we've specified that in the config snakelings will not move me to the hidden .data file when initializing the exercises for the user. 
This is useful for when you need a file to be present in root to be accessed from a python script.
