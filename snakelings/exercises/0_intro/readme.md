# WELCOME TO 🐍 SNAKELINGS!
Hello user, you have made such a fantastic choice choosing Snakelings to learn your desired language 🌟 Python. 
Don't worry I won't ramble for long because I know you've come here to **actually write code** instead of listen to another developer ramble. **SO LET'S GET STARTED!**

Okay I lied, give me one more 🙏 speech bubble. I'm glad you've already made it this far, **congratulations!** 🎊 
If it was already a challenge getting to this point, don't worry; from now on everything will be smooth ⛵ sailing. **NOW LET'S GET TO IT!!**
