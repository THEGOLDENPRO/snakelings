**Great!** Now that you know what a comment is and how to remove such todo comments we'll have throughout our exercises, let's throw you into the next exercise.

We have some code at ***"{code_path}"*** that should print **"Hello, World!"** to the console but the syntax is incorrect; it needs changing or else python will throw an error and the program will crash like you are seeing below the task instructions. This is what we call a **traceback** in Python; try and interpret it and complete the task below.

***TIP:** The traceback will help you. ðŸ˜‰*

# The Task!
1. Fix the code at "{code_path}" to print "Hello, World!".

2. Then remove the `# I'M NOT DONE YET!` comment and save the file.
