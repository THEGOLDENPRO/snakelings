# Let's assign some variables!
There is a variable define currently named `cat_amount` but it looks like someone forgot to assign an integer value to it.

Can you assign the int `7` to the variable?

# The Task!
1. Assign the int `7` to the `cat_amount` variable.

2. Then remove the `# I'M NOT DONE YET!` comment and save the file.
