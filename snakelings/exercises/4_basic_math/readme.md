# Let's do some simple math.

So at ***"{code_path}"*** we have a function like so --> `do_math()`. You don't need to worry much about how "functions" work at this stage of your learning but just know that this function returns a **value** and in our case this value it's returning is currently `40`.

However we need the `do_math()` function to return `60` instead of `40`. Have a look at the function and try adjusting the values appropriately.

# The Task!
1. Fix the code at "{code_path}" to make the function return the integer value `60`.

2. Then remove the `# I'M NOT DONE YET!` comment and save the file.
